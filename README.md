# Arena

This project is a way to test the battle results of different monsters in D&D 5th Edition.
The UI let's you select two creatures from the loaded creature list, then you can press the "Fight!" button.
During a fight, the two monsters engage in a randomized battle as per the rules of the game.
After 100 combat simulations are run, some statistics are output:
- Win/loss ratio
- Ratio of critical hits per fight
- Average hit ratio
- Average margin of defeat

### Tech
Built using JavaScript and jQuery, with data being pulled from a JSON object.


### TODO
- add spells (game mechanic)
- randomize or different action options
  - intelligent action selection (i.e. use a healing spell when low on health)
- allow for advantage or disadvantage (game mechanic)
- incorporate saving rolls (game mechanic)
- incorporate more monsters
